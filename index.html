        <h1>Keyboard Accessibility Features</h1>
        <p>This website was designed to be accessible for keyboard users. Here are the main features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All of the navigation links and buttons can be accessed using the <strong>Tab</strong> key. Press <strong>Tab</strong> to move forward and <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> to move backward through the page.</li>
            <li>The focus indicator visually highlights links and buttons with a custom border when tabbing.</li>
            <li>The “Sort List” button can be activated with the <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Space</strong> key when tabbing.</li>
            <li>Keyboard users can press the <strong>'S'</strong> key as a shortcut to activate the sort function.</li>
            <li>All of the links on the “Things to Read” page are accessible using the <strong>Tab</strong> key.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How This Follows the<strong> Usability Principles</strong></h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Affordance: </strong> This follows the usability principle of affordance because the "Sort List" button clearly looks and behaves like a button. The shape and label of the button tells the user what it does. The user perceives the button to sort the list of intersts. When the user clicks on it, it will sort the list. This matches the user's expectation and helps them understand how to use it by simply just looking at it.</li>
            <li><strong>Visibility: </strong> This follows the usability principle of visibility because the focus indicator clearly outlines the items when tabbing to help the user see where they are on the page.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback: </strong> This follows the usability principle of feedback because when the "Sort List" button is clicked or activated with the 'S' key, the list immediately sorts. This change on the screen gives the user clear feedback that their action worked. They know that the list was sorted because they can see the order right away.</li>
            <li><strong>Constraints: </strong> This follows the usability principle of constraints because the website limits user interaction in a helpful way. For example, the "Sort List" button and pressing the 'S' key only works to sort the list of interests and not on any other parts of the page. This helps prevent confusion for the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Mapping: </strong> This follows the usability principle of mapping because users can navigate links and buttons using the <strong>Tab</strong> key and shortcuts. There is a clear and expected relationship between pressing Tab and moving through the items on the page. Pressing the 'S' key to activate the sort function is also a logical mapping because 'S' stands for sort, so it makes sense and is easy for the user to remember what the key does.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency: </strong> This follows the usability principle of consistency because all of the links and buttons behave the same way on all of the pages. This makes the website easier to use and understand.</li>
        </ul>
